"""A library payload does not carry the compiler's C++ runtime.

The rule (decision D3 of the 2026-09-28 ecosystem design, mcpp-community/mcpp
`.agents/docs/2026-09-28-ecosystem-design-and-optimisation-plan.md`; the
recipe rule in docs/contributing.md §5.3): no recipe places a file of the MSVC C++
runtime set (`vcruntime140*.dll`, `msvcp140*.dll`, `concrt140.dll`,
`vccorlib140.dll`, the `Microsoft.VC*.CRT` redistributable directory) into its
payload, with one exception: the toolset package itself, whose redistributable
directory IS the compiler's runtime.

WHY. A program's C++ runtime must be at least as new as the newest toolset
that built one of its images. The build that links the program knows that
toolset; a library payload does not, and its copy is whatever version its
recipe pinned. mcpp placed `xim:qt-base`'s copy (14.44) beside programs built
with a newer toolset (review 2026-09-28 §2.1), and since 2026.9.28.2 it
prefers the toolset's set and states a dependency's copy as a packaging fault.
A payload's own host tools (Qt's `moc.exe`) start with the toolset's runtime,
which the engine puts first on every action's PATH for a Windows target.

The check reads recipe source: code lines, not comments, that name the
redistributable archive, its CRT directory, or a runtime DLL.
